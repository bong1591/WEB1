      <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://opentutorials.org/course/743" target="_blank" title="JavaScript sepcification">JavaScript</a>,[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
        It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
        Alongside Html and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.
        [7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.
        The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
